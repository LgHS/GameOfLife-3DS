# Conway's Game of Life for Nintendo 3DS

Simply download the 3dsx file and run it with your prefered hb launcher.7

To build the project yourself, there's a visual studio project and a make file, require DevKitPro ARM Toolchain (https://github.com/devkitPro/). There's also a Travis CI yaml and script to build the project using Travis CI and Docker.

For support contact me or anybody on EFNet #3dsdev, nice community, you'll get real help there.
